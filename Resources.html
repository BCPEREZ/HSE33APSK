        The Project Description of the group HSE33 is
        <br>
        Help the community of Alangilan,
Batangas to help solve their waste management issues. Our project
will be a website about Alangilan, its waste management issues, and
how we can all help in improving and removing the land pollution in
their area.

        A website that can encourage everyone to do
proper waste garbage disposal in their own home. The group would
present possibilities that can happen if they will not do proper waste
disposal at home. The group would also present weekly updates on
the website. The updates in the website will be from someone in the
targeted community.
