    <center><h3>Why should we need to do these reasons?</h3></center>
    <p>
        Aside from benefitting your individual and community safety,
     proper waste disposal is also a responsibility towards the environment.
     Wate management reduces the burden of plastics and mass generation of
    materials. It also promotes composting and other practices that do not
    contribute to climate change.

            Hurting The Earth
        </h3>
    </center>
    <div>Segregating trash is important for a few reasons that all tie into protecting our environment. Here's how improper trash disposal hurts the Earth:
<br>
<br>
        Less Recycling: When all our trash gets mixed together, it becomes difficult or impossible to sort out recyclable materials like plastic, paper, and metal.  These recyclable items then get sent to landfills instead of being re-processed into new products. This means we waste resources and create a demand for more raw materials, which can harm the environment through mining and logging.
        <br><br>
        Landfill Problems: Landfills take up a lot of space and can contaminate nearby soil and water if they leak.  When we throw away organic waste like food scraps and yard trimmings, it decomposes in landfills and produces methane, a harmful greenhouse gas.  Landfills are already overflowing, and improper waste segregation makes the problem worse.
        <br><br>
        Pollution:  Not all trash decomposes harmlessly.  Certain items, like electronics and hazardous waste, contain toxic materials that can leak out and contaminate the environment if not disposed of properly.   This can harm wildlife and pollute our air and water.
        <br><br>
        By segregating our trash, we can reduce the amount going to landfills, conserve resources, and prevent pollution. It's a simple way to make a big difference for the environment.</div>
        <br><br>
        <center><h3>Harming Community Members</h3></center>
        <div>
            Improper trash disposal can have some pretty nasty consequences for our health and well-being. Here's how it can harm us:
<br><br>
Disease:  Piles of unsorted trash create breeding grounds for pests like mosquitos, rats, and cockroaches.  These pests can carry diseases that can spread to humans, making us sick.
<br><br>
Contamination:  When trash ends up in places it shouldn't, like waterways or overflowing landfills, it can leak harmful chemicals into the environment.  This contamination can pollute our drinking water and the food we eat.
<br><br>
Air Quality:  Landfills overflowing with organic waste decompose and release methane, a greenhouse gas.  Burning trash also releases harmful pollutants into the air.  This air pollution can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.
<br><br>
Proper waste segregation helps keep our communities clean and reduces the risk of these problems. It's a way to protect ourselves and create a healthier environment for everyone.
        </div><br><br>
        <center><h3>Helping The United Nations Goal</h3></center>
        <div>Improper waste segregation and poor trash management definitely hinder the progress of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Here's how:
<br><br>
            UNSDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:  Segregating trash and managing it effectively is crucial for clean, healthy cities.  Mixed waste makes recycling difficult and leads to overflowing landfills, both of which contribute to pollution and health problems in communities.
  <br><br>          
            UNSDG 13: Climate Action:  Landfills overflowing with organic waste create methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change.  Proper waste management, including composting food scraps, helps reduce methane emissions.
    <br><br>        
            UNSDG 14: Life Below Water & UNSDG 15: Life on Land:  Unsegregated trash can end up in waterways and oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems.  Toxic materials in improperly disposed waste can also leach into the soil and contaminate land, harming plant and animal life.
       <br><br>    
            By not segregating trash, we make it harder to achieve these important goals.  The UNSDGs promote a sustainable future for all, and waste management is a key piece of that puzzle.
            <br><br>
            Here's what you can do to help:
            
            Segregate your own trash and encourage others to do the same.
            <br><br>Learn about your community's waste management programs and participate in recycling and composting initiatives.
            <br><br>Support businesses and organizations that prioritize sustainable practices, including waste reduction and responsible disposal.
           <br><br>By taking these steps, we can all contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet and support the UNSDGs.</div>
